Seems like there’d be wiser ways for this expert discord-sewer to sew discord. <!--1366515654833156098-->

The flyers read, “Is it a bird, is it a plane. No, it’s Wollaston’s Mystery Man.” pic.twitter.com/oTjsRzKFcc <!--1366446216872136712-->

Now, it’s fantastic, of course. <!--1366431369103106048-->

I like her skin and her hair!”  And then we both sieg heiled. No, seriously. I have a bunch of them. Kids naturally prefer their own. pic.twitter.com/SEHDhCx4me <!--1366430935533703170-->

They once stood on stage naked for 20 minutes to protest something or other and the shameful, uncensored photos still exist on the internet. pic.twitter.com/Q09P7xw7Y4 <!--1366420330248613894-->

That’s why progressive Christians would have you believe the lie that “all sins are equal.”  The minute ANYTHING is unequal, progressivism falls apart. <!--1366241842795282433-->
