I still feel guilty about it sometimes... but it was the right thing to do. <!--1105864656697085952-->

And here I was... fretting about adding another child to our very comfortable middle-class home. It was preposterous. I was subsidizing the expansion of HIS family while nearly preventing the expansion of mine. <!--1105864655648497668-->

It was taken at his birthday party... a party we‚Äôd sent extra money for. He was there... looking like a hostage... posed in front of a table of snacks (orange soda included!)... with his siblings. <!--1105864654352461824-->

My wife and I had just had our third child at the time... after much fretting about finances... you know, responsible family planning. Bullshit, all of it. Have more kids. <!--1105864653144510464-->

I STILL want to save them. I can‚Äôt turn off my white instinct for charity. I wouldn‚Äôt do it if I could, tbh. pic.twitter.com/QXrjX0F9sI <!--1105864651219394563-->

In return, we‚Äôd receive some handwritten updates and a photo or two every now and then. <!--1105864645657665536-->

I was being called a racist every day online while paying for an African kid‚Äôs food and medical care. pic.twitter.com/tcsnPPdQ56 <!--1105864644181282817-->

Whites are now forced to pay bribes to crooked admissions officers in order to get their children into the universities their ancestors built and attended. Some of these schools are 75% Asian + Jewish now. https://twitter.com/i/events/1105482859114979328 <!--1105494781856268294-->

In 2019, now that he‚Äôs rightly determined that his transition was the result of untreated mental illness... surely they‚Äôll publish a follow-up, right?  Nope. https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/03/10/i-was-americas-first-non-binary-person-it-was-all-a-sham/ <!--1105165771540451330-->

The kid show that recently made headlines for having Disney‚Äôs first gay character come out? It‚Äôs also ‚Äúincredibly Jewish‚Äù according to this Jewish publication.
