That sneaking feeling you feel in the back of your mind... the rumors you’ve heard... the community-shaped hole in your heart? It’s all real.   The world was a better place 30, 40, 50 years ago. And the men who took it from you have names and addresses. <!--1186010236211138561-->

What ever will we do without “11 Blankets That Are Actually as Soft as They Look” and “The Store-Bought Cakes You’ll Actually Be Proud to Serve?”  Learn.  To.

In campaign after campaign? Interview after interview?  This is what happens when you know there will be no formal pushback. You can lie freely. https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1185316131998851072 <!--1185903106665713664-->

They, of course, never invented a written language. So this is us, somehow? Is it just the onomatopoeia translation of their native tongue-click language? <!--1185900031292907521-->

I would’ve looked at you funny because I didn’t know about the Jews until I was like 35.   But, still. https://twitter.com/chuckwoolery/status/1185659133112061952 <!--1185728943388876800-->

Women are downright adorable, aren’t they? Even morbidly obese ones. https://twitter.com/Tess_Holliday/status/1184960443955236865 <!--1185581276213972992-->

The dog whistles of the 60s-2000s won’t work anymore.   This is, obviously, a good thing. <!--1185446140025737216-->

But, merely RESEMBLING Trump in 2024 will be grounds for excommunication from the GOP. <!--1185445882277367808-->

Even the illusion of representation will fall away. <!--1185445881497227264-->

Name one historic narrative in a Western nation that meets that definition now?  History has UNQUESTIONABLY been weaponized against us. By whom, though? I have some ideas. <!--1185213610102009858-->

Ending segregation was a bad idea. <!--1184907653165846528-->

Cops don’t always behave in wonderful ways... but they’ve been tasked with the truly impossible task of civilizing these monsters. There’s no good way to do it. None.
