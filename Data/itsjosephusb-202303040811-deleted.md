Throwing off the GOP chains will be good for the souls of our people. pic.twitter.com/QPlwPmUdQ3 <!--1192542424675102725-->

Black husband decapitates wife, slits daughter's throat, then hangs himself.  Invite violence incarnate into your home... breed with it... be consumed by it. It's a dark cycle repeated time and time again and it's heartbreaking. pic.twitter.com/wYtLQ2ioTf <!--1192522157265477632-->
