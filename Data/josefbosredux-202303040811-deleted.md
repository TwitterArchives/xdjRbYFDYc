But, he’s not Asian. And he’s not gay. So we’re not allowed to take HIS side publicly, to insist upon HIS safety.

That’d be nice... but here’s where you’re needed...  Help create and support a thriving wholesome white identity that acts as an alternative path.   It’s that easy. <!--1143890184116871174-->
